## üí¨ Anticipated Questions & Answers

### Technical Questions:

**Q: "How accurate is the transcription?"**
A: "Currently 85-95% in demo. Production version with specialized medical AI models will achieve 98%+ accuracy, which exceeds human medical scribes."

**Q: "What about HIPAA compliance?"**
A: "On-premises deployment ensures data never leaves hospital network. We're building HIPAA compliance from day one with encryption, audit trails, and access controls."

**Q: "How does EMR integration work?"**
A: "We use standard HL7 FHIR APIs. Our team has experience with Epic, Cerner, and other major EMR systems. Integration is part of our setup fee."

**Q: "What if the AI makes mistakes?"**
A: "Physicians always review and approve notes before saving. AI serves as intelligent first draft, not final authority. Reduces time from hours to minutes."

### Business Questions:

**Q: "Who's your competition?"**
A: "Nuance Dragon (outdated, expensive, cloud-based), Otter.ai (not medical-specific), human scribes ($50K+/year, scheduling issues). No one offers real-time, on-premises medical AI."

**Q: "How do you reach hospitals?"**
A: "Healthcare conferences, EMR partner channels, physician networks, healthcare consultants. Long sales cycles but high contract values and retention."

**Q: "What's your customer acquisition cost?"**
A: "Estimated $25K-35K per hospital. With $400K+ lifetime value and 5+ year retention, ROI is strong."

**Q: "How do you scale the technology?"**
A: "Cloud-native architecture deployed on-premises. Each hospital runs independent instance. Central AI model updates pushed to all installations."

### Investment Questions:

**Q: "How much funding do you need?"**
A: "Seed round: $500K for team and pilot customers. Series A: $3M for sales team and market expansion. Clear path to profitability by Year 2."

**Q: "What's the exit strategy?"**
A: "Multiple paths: Strategic acquisition by EMR vendors (Epic, Cerner), healthcare IT companies (Nuance, 3M), or tech giants (Microsoft, Google). IPO potential at $100M+ revenue."

**Q: "What's your team background?"**
A: "Combination of healthcare domain expertise, AI/ML technical skills, and enterprise sales experience. Building advisory board of hospital CIOs and practicing physicians."
